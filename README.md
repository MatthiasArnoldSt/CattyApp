Hello :) 
My name is Matthias, I am one of the candidates for the Software QA Engineer position at Netizen Testing.

Link to live demo: https://matthiasarnoldst.github.io/CattyApp/  

I built a mobile-first web application where users can view a stack of cat images and express their preferences. The core interaction revolves around swiping right to "like" and left to "dislike". In addition, as required, 
the application fetches real-time cat data from the Cataas API and provides a summary of the user's liked cats upon completion.

The key features include:
- Gestural Interaction: Smooth touch and mouse-based swiping logic (Swipe Right to Like, Swipe Left to Dislike).
- Dynamic Content: Asynchronously fetches 10 unique cat images using the Cataas API.
- Summary Dashboard: Displays a collection of "Liked" cats after the stack is finished.
- Undo Functionality: An "Undo" button allows users to reverse their last swipe if they made a mistake.
- Responsive Design: Fully optimized for mobile devices with specific CSS adaptations for different screen sizes and orientations.
- Accessibility: Includes keyboard navigation (Arrow keys), high contrast mode support, and reduced motion preferences.
